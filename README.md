# Methods and Evolution Trends of Applied Computer Science
> The study course is dedicated to discussions on modern methods of applied computer science with an emphasis on research conducted at Riga Technical University. Students are encouraged to analyse online materials, periodical publications, and current information from scientific conferences and symposia, following trends in applied computer science and evaluating their development prospects. Independent work promotes the use and development of the latest trends in applied computer science in the master thesis.

> ## grading 
> - There are multiple individual assignments in report and/or presentation format which are evaluated.
> - Independent studies include performing research within the Master Thesis with the aim to synthesize it with the information considered within the course.
> - The course final grade is calculated as a weighted average of individual assignments (see Tentative outline) and an examination.
> - More than one-month late submission and/or violation of academic integrity* decreases the assignment grade potentially down to failed.
> - During the semester, the progress will be reflected in the Grades section of the course.

Use the Functional features table template to:
- Refine problem domain description according to the discussion/lecturer feedback comments.
- Fill a functional features (FFs) table and design an initial TFM. (You can choose any appropriate tool for the TFM creation, e.g. Visio, draw.io, Word, etc.)
- Submit the refined description, FFs table and initial TFM before the next class.
